# Budgeter
## A WPF Application to manage your budget

A simple WPF application to calculate your income, expenditures in order to give you a grand total.
As a father in a growing family, I am getting more and more used to sudden / unexpected / unwanted demands to my hard earned cash.

This app was simply a way to practice my coding abilities, get a grip with WPF and XAML, and develop something vaugely useful in the process.

Ideally, the user would enter their individual incomes, and their values. 
They would do the same with their outgoings. 

It would be displayed in a simple list box, and a grand total would be re-calculated each time a new item was added.

This was the minimal design and is currently at this stage.

## Plans for the Future

- Write to an XLS file
- Read from an XLS file
- Add a date field in the Income and Expenditure classes, to track when income comes in and outgoings go out.
- A clear button to clear indivudal items in the lists, rather than clearing all of them at once
